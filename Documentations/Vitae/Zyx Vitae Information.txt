About Me:
Hi, I am Zyx and i love technology.

I was from philippines and fancy technology.
As technology are tools for your creation that 
creates your happiness. And once its done you smile
and it will serve its purpose until it meets its end.
A gentle cycle of life. At which I settle in studying
Computer Science after couple of year of wondering. 
Then at that point I admire where few words and numbers
can create world only lives in mind and makes the living
seems so easy away from what it used to be.

I discovered my world with travel, nature and tech. 
World offer beautiful creation which inspires for your creativity.
Encouraging you to visit how beautiful God works is.
And makes you wonder how complex and how everything ticks
trying to simulate with tools that present or the one you will build
